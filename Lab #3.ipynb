    "In Lab 3, I will be editing lab 2 with newfound data cleaning information on Pandas. In this lab I will be analyizing the Starbucks Nutritional Drink data. Within my analysis, I will be answering the following questions that the data posed: Which drink has the most and least of each nutrional section? How many different drinks are there? What percentage of drinks have 2% milk?\n",
    "\n",
    "I added (new analysis and cleaning) to lab 3, what are the mean values from each data section? and I attempted to fix the dietary fiber column header. I also replaced all of my code with simpler code using pandas data package. "

Furthermore, I would have liked to be able to change the header name but for some reason, by using the same code that worked in Lab 4 on the candy data, Lab 3 would not stop giving me the same error message. \n",
